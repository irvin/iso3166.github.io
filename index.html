        <p>The "official" ISO 3166 short English names for those countries and regions which are in some cases controversial. It do not necessarily refer to nation-states (e.g. Taiwan, Kosovo, Hong Kong...) and should not be treated as such, and not all of them are commonly used in the world.</p>
        <h2>best practice</h2>
        <p>When listing countries or other geographic areas in documentation, menus, mirror lists, or other contexts, it is important to introduce such lists as "Countries or Regions" so that an implied sovereignty claim is neither made nor denied to those regions.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how open source projects and technology companies deal with this "ISO 3166" problem:</p>
